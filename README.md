# blazor.internetjumppage
A Blazor client and .NET core service to make a handy internet start page for your users.

A handy real world example of using Blazor, written for my Blazor talk at Duke Studios in Leeds April 9th 2019.

Please note, it still needs some work doing on the data services, and the index page to display the view I wanted, but... I ran out of time to finish it before pushing it to GH in time for my talk.
